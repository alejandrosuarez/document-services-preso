## Document Services Presentations

I'm using this repository for all my Adobe Document Services presentations. Since many use the same demos, I figured one repo would work fine. 

* [/decks/main/index.html](./decks/main/index.html) is my general 1 hour-ish presentation that covers *everything*, Embed + Services + DocGen + Extract
* [/decks/developerslive/embed/preso.pdf](./decks/developerslive/embed/preso.pdf) is my thirty minute Embed presentation for Adobe PDF Developers live.

## History

9/23/2021: Today I made the decks folder so I can keep different presentations in their own area. This will break main.html until I get a chance to fix the images, maybe. I'm moving imgs there too so it may be ok. Basically, I'm reorganizing a bit and leaving "main" unchecked till later. :)
