"A. How well did the mechanics of the study process work out? • How well did the scheduling of studies work out? Did studies start early enough? Were the results delivered at the right time?   • How well did the NASA-PSDS interfaces work? What worked best/worst? For example, what did you think of your interface and interactions with NASA HQ, PSDS panels, center study teams, and science champions?      • Was the scope of the study effort matched to the study teams’ capabilities?   • Were there enough resources to cover the study scope (people, processes, and tools)?   • Was the process consistent across study centers?   • Was the role of the study center lead scientists helpful?       "
B. What worked well with the study process? What did not? What can NASA do to improve in the future?
