A.  ,"Was the approach to identifying the right architecture options appropriate?  • Were there any good architecture options that were not explored? If so, why? In retrospect, do you think any lower cost implementations may have been missed?      • What did you think of the trade space exploration process as a precursor to point design studies? Was there appropriate evaluation of alternative architectures prior to diving into a point design?   How should it be applied in a future Decadal Survey?   Was the JPL RMA process applied uniformly across the study centers?      • Were the NASA ground rules appropriate and useful?   • Was the concept of Concept Maturity Level (CML) useful for the Decadal Survey? How did concept maturity assessments vary between design centers?   How did fidelity of point designs vary between design centers?   Would you recommend the CML concept be part of future Decadal Surveys?       "
B.  ,Was the approach to identifying the right technology needs appropriate?  • What criteria were used in deciding to include or exclude new technologies?   • Was the mapping of mission needs to technology requirements adequate?    
C.  ,What worked well with the study approach? What did not? What can NASA do to improve in the future?
