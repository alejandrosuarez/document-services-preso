INSTRUCTIONS  
"The purpose of this form is to gather feedback based on your experience with the Planetary Science Decadal Survey mission study process in order to assess and improve NASA’s mission study efforts. This form is divided into five main sections: study approach, study process, study results, study products, and final thoughts. Each section has 2–3 questions with bulleted sub-questions. It is not necessary to address all of the sub-questions. Rather, these sub-questions are intended to suggest topics that you may want to discuss in responding to the main question. Respond to each question however you feel is appropriate to provide information that could be used to improve future NASA planetary science mission and technology studies.  To fill out the form, simply click in any answer field and begin typing.  Please email the completed form or questions to psds-mission-studies-lessons@jpl.nasa.gov.  "
"USE OF DATA  Responses will be treated discretely, without attribution. Responses will be compiled and synthesized to derive lessons learned.  "
