To date the debate has been dominated by astronomy despite the fact that the mountain is located in a conservation district which, as stated in HRS183C, is intended to “ . . . conserve, protect, and preserve the important natural resources of the State through appropriate management and use to promote their long-term sustainability and the public health, safety and welfare”. While astronomical development is currently allowed in this district as a subuse, a new comprehensive management plan for the area of use is required that revisits what is appropriate for the mountain. The importance of this requirement was underscored in a 2006 decision by the Third Circuit Court that revoked the CDUP granted to NASA because of the lack of a comprehensive management plan.

Second, the missing information on threatened and invasive species is especially alarming. With the increase of access to Mauna Kea, fountain grasses as well as ants and spiders are expanding rapidly up the mountain.  Once invasive species are identiﬁed, action from the Big Island Invasive Species Program is required and appropriate management and monitoring will follow. Third, the current representation of the vegetation is misleading. Understanding the vegetative mosaic of Mauna Kea requires understanding its transect which illustrates the interconnectedness of the ecosystems and culture, a concept that is missing from public documentst. This omission has served piecemeal decision-making ruled illegal in other situations.  Fourth, a comprehensive natural resources management and monitoring plan at Hale Pohaku and the summit was recommended by Char in the unadopted 2000 Master Plan because none exists.

Wekiu bugs may return to these slopes in time, but only if the population within the crater survives until the preferred habitat develops.
